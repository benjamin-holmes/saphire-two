# SaphireII
Saphire is a job tracking application that is written in CSS, HTML, and Javascript all with the help of Electron. The goal was to make a desktop application for Windows which was usable while disconnected from the internet at work sites. The user is able to add jobs which are then stored into a local SQLite database.

# Coming Soon
Backup/ Sync function to keep an active copy of the database on a remote database.
